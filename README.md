# Mod Loading Screen

An advanced loading screen with the loading progress of mods. It works on all Minecraft versions, as it doesn't even require Minecraft. Its only requirement is Fabric Loader 0.12.0 or later or Quilt Loader (specific versions of Quilt support are unknown). Do note that if you run this mod on a game other than Minecraft, the loading screen may not close itself.
